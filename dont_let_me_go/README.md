###  Don't Let Me Go
App for tracking expiration dates of food. The user can choose food category (5 basic and "other"), pick the expiration date and give their product a name by clicking a floating action button which opens a bottom sheet with fields to fill. All the food is saved in a local SQLite database. If the product's expiration day is the current day, the date is red colored to indicate this. To delete expired product, the user can click a trash bin icon and an alert window pops up.
